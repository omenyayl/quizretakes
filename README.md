# Quiz Retakes Scheduler
This is my project for a Software Testing and Maintenance class at George Mason University.

## Installing
Navigate to the releases page and download the latest release.

## Usage
The JAR file is found inside the Quizretakes.zip file in the [releases](https://github.com/omenyayl/quizretakes/releases) page. You can also click [here](https://github.com/omenyayl/quizretakes/releases/download/1.2.1/quizretake.zip) to download the latest release.

Extract quizretakes.zip, then simply double click on the JAR executable to run the application. If that does not work, or if you are on Linux, try entering the following in the terminal:

``
java -jar ./quizretakes.jar
``

NOTE: This application requires Java 8!

Before you run the application, make sure that your XML data files are located on the same directory as the JAR executable.

## Development
You can easily clone this repo and start developing immediately with IntelliJ IDEA. 

To run the application, right click on the Main class located in src/main/java/quizretakes, and click run. 

To run tests, right click on src/test/java, and click Run 'All Tests'
