# Quiz Retakes Scheduler
This is my project for a Software Testing and Maintenance class at George Mason University.

## Installing
Navigate to the releases page and download the latest release.

## Usage
The JAR file is found inside the Quizretakes.zip file in the [releases](https://github.com/omenyayl/quizretakes/releases) page. Simply double click on the JAR executable to run the application. If that does not work, try entering the following in the terminal:

``
java -jar ./quizretakes.jar
``

Before you run the application, make sure that your XML data files are located on the same directory as the JAR executable.
